        <p>Greeked text is used in typography to evaluate a certain typeface's appropriateness, overall style or type color. Because a viewer can be distracted by meaningful content, 
            greeking unimportant text forces the viewer to focus on layout and design.</p>


        <p>Greeking is also used when a design is being developed but the content is unfinished. One example might be the layout of a magazine article which has photographs but no text; 
            initially, a lorem ipsum text is used, and then the nonsense text is replaced with draft versions as they become available. This allows design and layout to be carried out in 
            parallel with content revisions.</p>

        <p>Greeking can refer to the automatic rendering of text characters as unreadable symbols or lines in the layout preview function of word processing documents, 
            either to speed up screen display or because the graphics display capabilities of the monitor are insufficient for rendering extremely small texts.</p>

        <p>The term "greeking" was applied by various WYSIWYG editors of the 1980s, such as ApplixWare and Island Graphics. Greeking referred to the substitution of text with a 
            placeholder gray bar upon moving out of focus.</p>

        <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, 
                and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
               because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who 
               loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great 
               pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault 
               with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
